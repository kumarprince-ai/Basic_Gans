# Basic_Gans
This code defines a simple GAN that generates images resembling handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It trains the generator and discriminator networks iteratively. During training, the generator tries to produce images that can fool the discriminator, while the discriminator learns to distinguish real images from fake ones.
