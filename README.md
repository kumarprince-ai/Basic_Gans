# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Example

This repository contains a basic implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using TensorFlow and Keras. The GAN is trained to generate images resembling handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Getting Started

To run the GAN training code and generate images, follow these steps:

1. Install the required libraries by running:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gan-mnist-example.git
cd gan-mnist-example
Run the gan.py script:

bash
Copy code
python gan.py
The GAN will start training and generate images as it progresses through the epochs.

File Structure
gan.py: The main GAN training script.
README.md: This readme file.
Results
During training, the GAN will periodically save generated images in the repository directory. You can view the generated images to observe the progress of the GAN.
